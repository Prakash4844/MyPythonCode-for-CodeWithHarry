# A Prorgram to print contents of a list using while loop in Python
# Author: Prakash

i = 0
aList = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 8]

while (i < len(
        aList)):  # Finding the length of aList which is 6 and iterating loop till < 7 because intex starts from 0    print(aList[i])
    i += 1

print(len(aList))  # Length is 7
