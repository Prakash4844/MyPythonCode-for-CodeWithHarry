    """
    A class method is a method that is bound to a class rather than its object. It doesn't require creation of a class instance, much like static method.

    The difference between a static method and a class method is:

    1.Static method knows nothing about the class and just deals with the parameters
    2.Class method works with the class since its parameter is always the class itself.
    
    Class method: Used to access or modify the class state. In method implementation, if we use only class variables, 
    then such type of methods we should declare as a class method. The class method has a cls parameter which refers 
    to the class.
