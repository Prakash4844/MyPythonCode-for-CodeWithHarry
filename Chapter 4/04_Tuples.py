# Creating a Tuples uses (), even if tuple have 1 value it needs an extra Comma
t1 = (5,)  # Tuple with single element, if comma is not used it would not recognize it as tuple
# t1 = (5) #Wrong way to declare Tuple with single element
print(t1)

t2 = ()  # Empty Tuple

t = (0, 8, 6, 9, 4, 'A')  # This is a Tuple, Tuples can't be updated, it can hold data of Multiple Datatypes
print(t)  # we can print tuple by tuple's name

print(t[0])  # you can print individual values by Specifying Their Index, Index starts at 0
print(t[2])  # if Index value is out of Range it will throw an error in this case t[7] would be out of range
print(t[5])

# t[0]=5 #IT will Throw an Error as tuple is immutable (can't be updated)
