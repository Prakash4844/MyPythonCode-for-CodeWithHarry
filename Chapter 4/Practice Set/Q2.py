S1 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 1:"))
S2 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 2:"))
S3 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 3:"))
S4 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 4:"))
S5 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 5:"))
S6 = int(input("Enter Marks Of Student 6:"))

Students = [S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6]  # sorted marks of 6 students
Students.sort()

print(Students)
