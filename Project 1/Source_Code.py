# Snake, water or gun game in Python
# Author: Prakash

'''
This just like stone paper scissor. Both the players should keep the gestures simultaneously. 
The snake drinks the water, the gun shoots the snake, and gun has no effect on water.

import random  # Python Random Module

'''
This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.

For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. 
For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, 
a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, 
and a function for random sampling without replacement.
