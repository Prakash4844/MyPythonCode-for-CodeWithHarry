'''
a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. 
As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable, 
a function can be called(used) any numbers of times.

# The def keyword is used to create, (or define) a function.
def percentage(alist):  # Functions can take any no of parameters inside (), although it's optional
    # The information received by called function are known as parameters.
    # A function can return data as a result, here we are returning percentage to caller

    percent = ((alist[0] + alist[1] + alist[2] + alist[3]) / 120) * 100  # --|

# Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
# Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
# You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
# The information passed by caller are called arguments
