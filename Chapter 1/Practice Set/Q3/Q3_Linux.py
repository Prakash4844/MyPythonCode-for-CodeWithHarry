Using playsound module

Run the following command to install the packages:

$ pip install playsound


    1. The playsound module contains only a single function named playsound().
    2. It requires one argument: the path to the file with the sound we have to play. It can be a local file, or a URL.
    3. Thereâ€™s an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. We can set it to False for making the function run asynchronously.
    4. It works with both WAV and MP3 files.
